# Flash USB Drive with Arch Linux ISO

Compute the SHA256: `sha256sum ~/Downloads/archlinux-2024.04.01-x86_64.iso`

Format and flash the USB drive with this utility:

```bash
# READ the following and run with caution
lsblk # To see what disks are listed
cd ~/Downloads/
sudo dd status=progress if=archlinux-2024.04.01-x86_64.iso of=/dev/sda bs=4M
sync
```

# Install Arch

"Keep as much of the defaults as possible, unless you have a good reason"

# How to go into the newly installed system to fix issues:

- SDDM Login Manager
- `Ctrl + Alt + F6` - Terminal Mode
- `Ctrl + Alt + F2` - GUI Mode

# Chroot into partition to edit files and fix the computer

```bash
# https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHGNkp7mYMc
lsblk # To see what disk to unencrypt
cryptsetup open /dev/vda2 cryptroot
mount /dev/mapper/cryptroot /mnt
nano /mnt/@/etc/fstab # To see the the mount points, which the following commands are created from:
mount -o subvol=@ /dev/mapper/cryptroot /mnt
mount -o subvol=@home /dev/mapper/cryptroot /mnt/home
mount -o subvol=@pkg /dev/mapper/cryptroot /mnt/var/cache/pacman/pkg
mount -o subvol=@log /dev/mapper/cryptroot /mnt/var/log
mount /dev/vda1 /mnt/boot
arch-chroot /mnt
```

# Connect to the Internet After Install (if Network Manager is not present)

- Guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loJKf1zr1bU

```bash
nmcli r wifi on
nmcli d wifi list
nmcli connections show
